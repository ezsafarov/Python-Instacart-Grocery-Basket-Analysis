# Instacart Grocery Basket Analysis

## Objective

This project is carried out to demonstrate Python skills in data analysis by working with Instacart's grocery sales data. The analysis aims to uncover key customer segments, purchasing behaviors, and trends to optimize marketing strategies and enhance customer engagement.

## Context

Instacart, an online grocery retailer, is interested in understanding customer behaviors, shopping patterns, and sales trends. This project focuses on identifying the busiest shopping periods, high-demand product categories, and customer segmentation to improve targeted marketing efforts.

## Key Questions

The analysis seeks to answer:

What are the busiest shopping days and hours?
When do customers spend the most money?
How can products be grouped into simpler price ranges?
Which product categories have the highest order frequency?
How do ordering habits vary based on loyalty, region, age, income, and family status?

## Tools & Technologies Used

Python Libraries: pandas, NumPy, os, matplotlib, scipy, seaborn
Development Environment: Jupyter Notebook (via Anaconda)

## Analysis Process

Data Import & Exploration – Load datasets, check structure, and assess completeness.
Data Cleaning & Preparation – Handle missing values, remove duplicates, and adjust data types.
Feature Engineering – Create new customer segmentation variables and price groupings.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Identify trends in ordering frequency, peak sales times, and product demand.
Visualization & Insights – Generate bar charts, histograms, line plots, and scatterplots.
Final Reporting & Recommendations – Summarize findings, propose marketing strategies, and document insights.

## Data Ethics & Privacy

This project adheres to data privacy best practices and ensures customer information is handled responsibly. The analysis is based on publicly available data, with additional fabricated elements for educational purposes.
